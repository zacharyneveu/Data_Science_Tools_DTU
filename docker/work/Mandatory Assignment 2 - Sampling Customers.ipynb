    "# Mandatory Assignment 2: Sampling Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the second of three mandatory assignments to be handed in as part of the assessment for the course 02807 Computational Tools for Data Science at Technical University of Denmark, autumn 2019.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical info\n",
    "- **The assignment is to be done individually. You are under no circumstances allowed to collaborate with anyone on solving the exercises (cf. the full policy on this on the course website)**\n",
    "- **You must hand in one Jupyter notebook (this notebook) with your solution**\n",
    "- **The hand-in of the notebook is due 2019-11-10, 23:59 on DTU Inside**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your solution\n",
    "- **Your solution should be in Python**\n",
    "- **You may use more cells than the provided ones for your answers**\n",
    "- **You should not remove the problem statements**\n",
    "- **Your notebook should be runnable, i.e., clicking [>>] in Jupyter should generate the result that you want to be assessed**"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "When computing group aggregates from a sample, simple random sampling does not give good results. Instead, a representative sample can be obtained by storing each record seen from a sample of the elements we group by. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you should implement this sampling method on a stream of customer spendings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Suppose you are sampling from a stream of customer spendings. Each element of the stream consists of a customer ID and an amount. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 29.99`\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a representative sample, you should sample some customer IDs and make sure that every occurrence of the sampled customer IDs are in your final sample. For example, if the customer ID `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000` is among the sampled customer IDs, every element with this ID should be in your sample. "

    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "Implement an algorithm that computes a sample from the stream. The sample must be representative of customers, i.e., you should be able to answer group aggregate questions from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample size should be approximately 10% of the number of elements read from the stream.\n",

    "Hint 1: Since simple random sampling is not a good idea, you should not use the reservoir sampling algorithm.\n",
