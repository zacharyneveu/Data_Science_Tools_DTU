    "\n",
    "#### Practical info\n",
    "- **The project is to be done in groups of at most 3 students**\n",
    "- **Each group has to hand in _one_ Jupyter notebook (this notebook) with their solution**\n",
    "- **The hand-in of the notebook is due 2019-12-05, 23:59 on DTU Inside**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your solution\n",
    "- **Your solution should be in Python/PySpark**\n",
    "- **For each question you may use as many cells for your solution as you like**\n",
    "- **You should not remove the problem statements**\n",
    "- **Your notebook should be runnable, i.e., clicking [>>] in Jupyter should generate the result that you want to be assessed**\n",
    "- **You are not expected to use machine learning to solve any of the exercises**"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "[Airbnb](http://airbnb.com) is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodgings. In this project you will use Spark to analyze data obtained from the Airbnb website. The purpose of the analysis is to extract information about trends and patterns from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Loading, describing and preparing the data\n",
    "There's quite a lot of data. Make sure that you can load and correctly parse the data, and that you understand what the dataset contains. You should also prepare the data for the analysis in part two. This means cleaning it and staging it so that subsequent queries are fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Par 2: Analysis\n",
    "In this part your goal is to learn about trends and usage patterns from the data. You should give solutions to the tasks defined in this notebook, and you should use Spark to do the data processing. You may use other libraries like for instance Pandas and matplotlib for visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "- Processing data should be done using Spark. Once data has been reduced to aggregate form, you may use collect to extract it into Python for visualisation.\n",
    "- Your solutions will be evaluated by correctness, code quality and interpretability of the output. This means that you have to write clean and efficient Spark code that will generate sensible execution plans, and that the tables and visualisations that you produce are meaningful and easy to read.\n",
    "- You may add more cells for your solutions, but you should not modify the notebook otherwise."
